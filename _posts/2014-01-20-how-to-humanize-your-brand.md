# How to humanize your brand

As marketers pull out all stops in the process of building a brand and carving a niche for it in the face of stiff competition, there is one important aspect that many tend to overlook, and that is â€“ focusing on the human side of the brand.

When you, your customers and your social media followers are all human, why deprive your brand of this amazing quality. Why not let your audiences know that your brand is not just any other abstract entity and that it has a voice and a personality of its own.

In today's day and age, marked by short attention spans and incessant social media updates, humanizing your brand can give you that much needed edge. It will help you rise above competition, help you break free from clutter and increase your likability quotient. It assumes all the more importance in content marketing, given that your objective is to be seen as an interactive entity rather than a lifeless brand.

### Adding a human touch to your brand

Here are 5 ways in which you can humanize your brand.

1. **Give your brand a voice**: When it comes to communicating with customers, go beyond the usual mailers and other forms of traditional advertising. Learn to have engaging conversations with your customers. Let them know that your brand too has a voice of its own and is not just another cog in the marketing wheel. The best way to talk to your patrons these days is through social media. Make the most of it.

2. **Make sure your brand has personality and character**: It is essential for you to know what your brand stands for and what its strengths and weaknesses are. Only then can you give it a personality of its own, be it through ads or social media posts. Ensuring that your communication across media is consistent is a good way of lending character and authenticity to your brand.

3. **Talk, listen, apologize**: Once you have decided to humanize your brand, do all things that normal humans do. Interact with your customers regularly and learn to take online conversations offline. Social media platforms are a good place to start with. In case you goof up, there is absolutely no harm in apologizing. Everyone appreciates an honest 'Sorry' over a hasty cover-up.

4. **Most importantly care and share**: Caring and Sharing are two qualities that epitomize human behavior on both on and off social media. Sharing interesting content from other sources that would help your audience will go a long way in making your brand less mechanical. Not only will third party content bring authenticity to your discourse on Social Media, it will also let your fans know that you care about them and their problems.

5. **Forge an emotional connect**: All said and done, at the end of the day, human beings are emotional fools. Take your customers on an emotional journey with you as you evolve. It could mean you sharing trivia about your brand with them or asking them to share some of their memorable moments with you. Such emotional and nostalgia-filled exchanges are bound to strike a chord with your customers.

6. **Reveal your team to the world**: As humans, we are only attracted to other fellow human beings. Unveil your team, which is tirelessly working with you on the brand, to the world. Let your audiences see that there are people just like them who are behind the scenes. Showing your team to the world will definitely increase people's affinity for your brand and add a strong human element to it.

Making your brand behave like a human will not only help in retaining existing customers but also in acquiring new ones. Besides, after all that flooding of inboxes with mails (many of which are unread too) and bombarding of social feeds with ads (many of which are either ignored or forgotten), all one longs for is an interesting conversation. And humanizing your brand lets you do just that!
