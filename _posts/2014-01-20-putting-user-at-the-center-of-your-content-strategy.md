# Putting user at the center of your content strategy

### What are the brands doing right now:

They are resorting to all sorts of tactics to make sure they are heard and seen, (and in some cases, even felt) which is not exactly a bad thing. Then where are they going wrong? It is when they start excessively promoting themselves, that they lose out on their target audience. Brands must realize that memes are funny, 'me-me-me' is not.

### What are users doing right now:

In the digital world, a brand is exposed to all sorts of users. There are those who 'like' you, but not necessarily like you. Then there are those who Instagram more than they eat. You also have the troll brigade. One misstep and expect constant flow of social media posts ripping the brand's reputation to shreds. Well, it's high time brands realize that social media is the digital equivalent of thin ice. You must be extra careful.

## So what should brands do?

It's essential that you put the user at the centre of your content strategy. The rest will fall in place. Use the following as guardrails while developing a content strategy:

- You create content keeping your target group in mind; not only with a view to 'sell' but also engage them in a conversation.

- Remember: You can never have a one-size-fits-all approach in content marketing. Understand your user and plan accordingly.

- If your campaign is spread over a long duration, make sure to strategize in such a way that you begin with easy-to-share and easy-to-consume content. This way, you will warm up to the user and start off on a positive note.

- Constantly monitor user behavior. Believe it or not, the best of strategies will emerge by merely observing how the user has responded to and consumed your content.

- Ensure your content is SEO-friendly. In keeping with your content, make a note of the keywords that users are most likely to search for on the internet. This will greatly boost the reach of your marketing exercise.

- Humanize your brand by speaking about things that interest your audience. Give them a feeling of person-to-person communication as against product-to-person communication.
